# System Design: TinyURL

### Introduction <a href="#introduction-0" id="introduction-0"></a>

**URL shortening** is a service that produces short aliases for long URLs, commonly referred to as **short links**. Upon clicking, these short links direct to the original URLs. The following illustration depicts how the process works:

#### Advantages <a href="#advantages-0" id="advantages-0"></a>

The key advantages of a URL shortening service are:

* Shortened URLs are convenient to use: they optimize link usage across different forms of devices due to their enhanced accessibility and non-breakability.
* They are visually professional, engaging and facilitate a higher degree of sharing possibilities.
* They are less error-prone while typing.
* They require smaller storage space at the user’s end.

#### Disadvantages <a href="#disadvantages-1" id="disadvantages-1"></a>

The URL shortening service has some associated drawbacks as well. Some of them are as follows:

* We lose the originality of our brand by using a short URL generated by a third-party service. Many different brands using the same service get short URLs containing the same domain.
* Since we’re using a third-party service for URL shortening, the possibility of it getting shut down and wiping all our shortened URLs will always be there.
* Our business brand image depends on the trustworthiness of a URL shortening service. The wrong business move might negatively impact our business. The competition for acquiring the in-demand custom short URLs is immense, so it might be possible that the best custom URLs are already taken by the time we start generating short URLs.

### How will we design a URL shortening service? <a href="#how-will-we-design-a-url-shortening-service-0" id="how-will-we-design-a-url-shortening-service-0"></a>

We’ve divided the URL shortening service design into the following five lessons:

1. [**Requirements:**](requirements-of-tinyurls-design.md) This lesson discusses the functional and non-functional requirements of the URL shortening service, along with estimating the resources required to achieve these requirements. Moreover, it also lists down the fundamental building blocks needed to build such a service.
2. [**Design and Deployment:**](design-and-deployment-of-tinyurl.md) This explains the working and usage of each component, the linkage among them, and the overall working mechanism of them as a unit.
3. [**Encoder:**](encoder-for-tinyurl.md) This particular lesson unfolds the inner mechanism of the encoder used in the design, stating the reason we use it along with the mathematical explanation.
4. [**Evaluation:**](evaluation-of-tinyurls-design.md) Lastly, we test our design by considering different dimensions of our design requirements and include the possibility of improving it.
5. [**Quiz**](quiz-on-tinyurls-design.md): This lesson will test our understanding of the TinyURL design.

Let’s start by defining the requirements for a TinyURL-like URL shortening service.
